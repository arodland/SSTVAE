// A serial transport, presented to Hamlib as a socket it can connect to.
//
// `transport.hpp` explains why this works: Hamlib turns any backend
// into a network client when its pathname parses as `host:port`, so the
// whole of `native/cmake/hamlib.cmake`'s pinned radio list is reachable
// over a socket. This is the socket. It binds a listener on loopback,
// waits for exactly one connection, and pumps bytes between it and the
// transport for as long as the session lasts.
//
// **Loopback only, and that is a security property rather than a
// default.** The far end of this socket is an unauthenticated path to
// somebody's transmitter: anything that can connect can key it. So the
// bind address is `127.0.0.1` explicitly, never `INADDR_ANY`, and the
// port is ephemeral rather than well-known so it is not a thing to
// scan for. On Android the app sandbox is a second layer, but this file
// also builds and runs on the desktop, where it is the only one.
//
// **One connection, then done.** Hamlib's `network_open` connects once
// per `rig_open`, so a disconnect means the session is over -- and
// re-accepting would mean the pump-out thread having to hand its
// descriptor over mid-flight, which is a race in exchange for a case
// that does not arise. A `RigController` reconfigure builds a new
// backend and therefore a new bridge.
//
// **A thread per direction, not one thread polling both.** The
// alternative -- `poll()` the socket briefly, then read the transport
// briefly, forever -- costs tens of wakeups a second doing nothing on a
// device where a listening session is measured in hours of battery.
// Two threads that each block cost none. What it buys is paid for by
// `SerialTransport`'s threading contract, which both Android transports
// satisfy for free.
