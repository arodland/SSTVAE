// A byte pipe to a radio that is not a serial port.
//
// **Why this exists at all.** `docs/android.md` recorded rig control as
// dropping "for a structural reason, not a scoping one": Hamlib's
// serial layer opens a *path*, and Android hands an unprivileged app no
// `/dev/ttyUSB0`, so using it would mean patching a pinned dependency.
// The premise is right and the conclusion was wrong, because Hamlib
// does not actually require a serial port. `rig_open()` runs the
// configured pathname through `parse_hoststr()` -- which explicitly
// rejects `/dev/...` and `COM*` and accepts `host:port` -- and on a
// match sets `type.rig = RIG_PORT_NETWORK` for **any** model, not just
// model 2. `port_open()` then dispatches to `network_open()`. That is
// the mechanism behind the well-worn `rigctld -m <native model> -r
// <ser2net host>:4001` recipe, and it means a socket is a first-class
// transport for every backend Hamlib has.
//
// So: this interface is the byte pipe, `bridge.hpp` turns one into a
// loopback socket, and `bridged.hpp` hands Hamlib that socket's
// address. Nothing is patched, no backend is reimplemented, and the
// radio list on a phone is the radio list on the desktop -- which is
// the property worth all of this, since "which radios work" differing
// per platform is exactly what `native/cmake/hamlib.cmake` pins a
// version to avoid.
//
// **Qt-free and Hamlib-free on purpose**, and in `sstvae_core` rather
// than `sstvae_rig`: the whole mechanism is then testable in a
// `--no-rig` build against a fake transport, which is the same trade
// `rx::Decoder` makes so the receive loop tests need no onnxruntime.

// One end of a serial-shaped link: USB CDC/FTDI/CP210x through the
// Android USB host API, or an RFCOMM socket to a Bluetooth radio.
//
// **Errors are `RigError`**, the same type `RigBackend` throws, because
// everything above here reports rig trouble one way and an operator
// cannot act on the distinction between "the radio refused" and "the
// cable fell out" any differently.
//
// **Threading contract, and it is load-bearing.** `read()` and
// `write()` are called concurrently, from two different threads, for
// the whole life of a session -- see `bridge.hpp` for why one thread
// per direction is what avoids an idle poll loop on a phone. Both
// Android transports satisfy this naturally (separate USB endpoints;
// `BluetoothSocket`'s input and output streams are independent), which
// is the only reason it is allowed to be a requirement. `close()` may
// be called from a third thread while a `read()` is blocked, and
// **must wake it** -- that is how a session shuts down without waiting
// out a read timeout. `set_dtr`/`set_rts` may overlap a read or a
// write: on USB they are control transfers, on a separate endpoint
// from the data.
// The line settings a transport actually has to be given.
//
// **Not the same shape as `HamlibConfig`'s, and the difference is the
// point.** There, `Default` means *do not set the token* and leave the
// backend's own value -- right for almost every rig, and the reason
// those are enums with a Default member rather than guesses at 8-N-1.
// Over a socket that promise cannot be kept by inaction: Hamlib applies
// its per-rig defaults in `serial_open`, which a network port never
// reaches, so a transport given nothing would run at whatever the USB
// chip powered up with. `bridged.hpp`'s `resolve_serial_params` closes
// that by asking Hamlib what it *would* have used -- so "the backend's
// own value" keeps meaning the same thing on a phone as on a desktop.
