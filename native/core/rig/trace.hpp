// A place for the rig path to say what it is doing, below Hamlib.
//
// **This exists because a trace stopped exactly where the interesting
// part began.** `rig::set_debug_sink` gives an app Hamlib's own view --
// which for a radio that never answers is "I wrote six bytes and read
// nothing", repeated. That is one end of a chain whose other end is a
// USB endpoint on a phone, and nothing in between said anything: not
// the loopback bridge, not the transport, not which driver the Android
// USB layer picked for the device. So a failure inside our own code and
// a radio ignoring a correctly delivered command produced *byte for
// byte the same log*.
//
// Qt-free and Hamlib-free, in `sstvae_core`, so `bridge.cpp` and the
// Android transport can both write to it -- and so a `--no-rig` build
// still compiles and tests every line of it.
//
// **Off costs one relaxed atomic load.** This sits in the byte pump
// between Hamlib and the radio, so the check has to be cheap enough
// that leaving the calls in is not a decision anybody has to think
// about. Formatting the message is the caller's job and must be guarded
// by `tracing()`, which is why that is public rather than an
// implementation detail.
