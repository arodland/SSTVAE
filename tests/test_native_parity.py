"""Compare the C++ core against the Python reference, side by side.

This is the complement to `pytest --native`. That mode *substitutes* the
C++ implementations and runs the whole suite through them, answering
"does the port satisfy everything we require of the modem?". These tests
instead hold both implementations in one process and diff them
directly, answering "where exactly do they differ, and by how much?" --
which is the question you need answered when the first mode fails.

Skipped entirely when the extension module has not been built, so a
normal `pytest` run is unaffected. Build it with tools/build_native.sh.

The tolerances here are the same ones justified in
native/tests/test_golden.cpp; see that file for why they are not zero.
The short version: the reference builds its phasors on an argument up to
262 rad, where one ulp is 5.7e-14, so it carries ~3e-14 of error that
the C++ (which reduces the argument exactly, in integers) does not.
docs/todo.md has the fix for the Python side.
