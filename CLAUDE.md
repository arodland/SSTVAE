SSTVAE: image transmission over HF radio by sending convolutional
autoencoder latents as analog values on OFDM carriers (RADE-style).
See README.md for the waveform table and usage; the approved design
rationale lives in the plan history.

## Commands

- Run tests: `pytest` (fast, ~2 s; includes full modem end-to-end tests)
- Smoke-train: `python scripts/train.py --smoke --out /tmp/smoke`
- Full pipeline check: `sstvae_encode.py` → `sstvae_simulate.py` → `sstvae_decode.py`

## Architecture

- `sstvae/config.py` — every constant shared between modem, channel sim,
  and training. **All waveform/latent numbers must agree through this
  module**; several derived quantities assert integer consistency
  (e.g. GROUP_LATENTS divides evenly into frames).
- `sstvae/modem/` — NumPy DSP, no torch:
  - `ofdm.py` DFT-matrix mod/demod (24 carriers × 50 Hz at 950–2100 Hz;
    carriers on integer multiples of 50 Hz so the CP is truly cyclic).
  - `sync.py` preamble detect (lag-160 autocorrelation, energy-floored
    metric), fractional + integer-bin CFO, template timing.
  - `framing.py` per-group interleaver, Golay-coded header.
  - `modem.py` `Modem.modulate/demodulate`; pilot EQ with Catmull-Rom
    interpolation, EMA-smoothed sample-clock drift tracking, per-latent
    confidence weights.
  - `golay.py` Golay(24,12), brute-force soft ML decode.
- `sstvae/hfchannel.py` — channel sim (AWGN in 3 kHz convention,
  Watterson 2-path fading presets mpg/mpp/mpd, freq/clock offset).
- `sstvae/models/autoencoder.py` — encoder (unit-RMS tanh latents,
  132ch in 3 ordered groups of 44) and decoder (takes latents ×
  weights + weight planes; handles erasures/truncation).
- `sstvae/latent_channel.py` — stage-1 differentiable channel
  (AWGN, group truncation, erasures) used by `scripts/train.py`.

## Gotchas learned the hard way

- `dsp.to_baseband` is deliberately **unfiltered**: any FIR selective
  enough to matter smears past the 32-sample CP and causes ISI. The
  160-sample demod correlation already nulls the heterodyne image
  exactly. Only sync filters (its own copy).
- The timing tracker must be heavily smoothed: raw per-frame pilot
  phase slope sees multipath group delay (± many samples), while real
  clock drift is <0.1 sample/frame. Chasing it raw wrecked MPP fading
  performance.
- PAPR is envelope (PEP) based — clip the analytic-signal magnitude,
  not raw samples; measure with `dsp.papr_db`.
- The latent unit-RMS normalization is the on-air contract between
  encoder, modem, and training. Don't renormalize anywhere else.
- Local GPU is ROCm (`torch.cuda.is_available()` is true); never add
  CUDA-only dependencies.

## Status / next steps

Phase 1 (modem) and Phase 2 stage-1 training scaffold are complete.
Remaining: real-dataset training run (HF Jobs), stage-2 fine-tune
through a differentiable OFDM+fading channel with PAPR loss,
evaluation sweeps (PSNR/LPIPS vs SNR per mode), on-air calibration.
